# Projects

Here are some of the key projects I've worked on that showcase my expertise in AI, distributed systems, and cloud technologies.

## AI & Machine Learning Projects

### Vector Embedding Service
A scalable service for generating and managing vector embeddings for RAG applications. Built with PyTorch, FastAPI, and deployed on Kubernetes.

### LLM Fine-tuning Pipeline
An end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuning large language models on domain-specific data. Implemented with Hugging Face Transformers and optimized for distributed training.

## Cloud & Infrastructure

### Distributed Tracing System
A custom distributed tracing solution for microservices architectures that provides insights into system performance and bottlenecks.

### Kubernetes Operator for ML Workloads
A custom Kubernetes operator that manages the lifecycle of machine learning workloads, ensuring efficient resource utilization and fault tolerance.

## Data Engineering

### Real-time Analytics Platform
A streaming analytics platform built with Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Databricks that processes millions of events per second.

### Data Quality Framework
An automated framework for detecting and addressing data quality issues in large-scale data pipelines.
