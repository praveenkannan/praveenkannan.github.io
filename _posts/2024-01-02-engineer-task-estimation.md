# The Art of Engineering Task Estimation

## Visualizing the Estimation Process

## The Basics of Estimation

1. **Break it down**
   - Divide the task into smaller, manageable pieces
   - Estimate each piece separately
   - Add them up for a more accurate total

2. **Account for the hidden work**
   - Estimate not just the "happy path" coding time, but the full lifecycle:
     - Writing tests
     - Fixing bugs
     - Waiting on PR reviews
     - Iterating on feedback
     - Writing docs
     - Syncing with other teams
   - Add a buffer for integration headaches

3. **Use historical data**
   - What did similar tasks take in the past?
   - What surprised you last time?
   - Your past projects are a goldmine of insight — use them

4. **Multiply by a factor**
   - Even after breaking things down, apply a reality multiplier
   - One rule of thumb: estimate → add 50% for testing, then double it to correct for optimism
   - It sounds silly — until you start being right more often than wrong

## Estimating New Feature Builds (0 → 1)

This is where estimation becomes art.

When you're building something completely new, say a fresh module, a new product, or a never done before backend service, ambiguity is the default. Requirements are still forming. Tech choices aren't finalized. Unknowns are everywhere.

In these cases:
- Spend more time scoping
  - Write down what you know, what you don't, and what assumptions you're making
  - Collaborate with PMs and designers early to clarify edges
- De-risk early
  - Do a spike — a time-boxed exploration to test feasibility
  - Identify the riskiest parts and get them out of the way first
- Treat the estimate as a range, not a number
  - Something like "2-4 weeks, depending on X and Y" is more honest and useful than "3 weeks"
- Expect rework
  - That's not failure — that's the cost of discovery

## Embrace Uncertainty — But Make It Visible

The point of estimation isn't to be perfect. It's to align the team, reduce surprises, and improve over time. Great engineers don't just build code — they build predictability. That's what scales.
