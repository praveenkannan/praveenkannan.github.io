## Introduction to RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of information retrieval and generative AI models. By integrating external knowledge sources with large language models, RAG enables more accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses.

### Key Components

1. **Vector Embeddings**: Numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning
2. **Retrieval Mechanism**: Efficiently finding relevant information
3. **Generative Model**: Producing human-like text based on retrieved context

## Simple RAG Example

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
import torch
import faiss

def create_vector_embedding(text):
    # Tokenize and convert text to vector
    tokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(**tokens).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
    return embeddings.numpy()

def retrieve_relevant_context(query_embedding, knowledge_base, top_k=3):
    # Use vector similarity to find most relevant context
    index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
    index.add(knowledge_base)
    distances, indices = index.search(query_embedding, top_k)
    return [knowledge_base[i] for i in indices[0]]
```

## Conclusion

RAG represents a significant advancement in AI, bridging the gap between retrieval-based and generative approaches to natural language processing.
